Hi, my name is Gordon Leete. I am in my fourth year at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing my bachelors of science in Information Security & Forensics. I currently live in Rochester, New York. I enjoy food and cooking, I always try to keep an open mind and experience new things. I also love music, I have been playing bass guitar for eleven years and love to expand my musical horizons. Some of my favorite music services include Spotify, Pandora, and rdio. If you would like to contact me, please send an e-mail to: me@gordoleete.com
