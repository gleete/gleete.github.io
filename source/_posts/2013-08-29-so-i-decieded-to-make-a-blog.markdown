So I finally broke down and decieded to make a blog for the world to see. Iâ€™ve got some thoughts and ideas about technology and current events: some people find my stance on these issues mildly amusing. So I figured I would share them with the wonderful world of the internet. While my views may be strange, questionable, or outright WRONG, they are expressly my opinions and not the opinions my employer or anyone associated with myself. I hope you enjoy my ramblings. Cheers.
